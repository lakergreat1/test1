  "narrative": "On August 10, 2023, at 0656 hours, Constable Larry FLUFFY #362 and Constable Justin ADAMS #779 were dispatched to the area behind the Landmark Inn at 1010 Dawson Road regarding a weapons call. Before their arrival, they were informed that a male complainant, Matthew ACHNEEPINESKUM, had informed the communications department of sustaining a stab wound behind the Holiday Inn and that the accused was still in the vicinity. However, communications later advised that Matthew was at his residence at 704 First Street. A phone ping confirmed his location near 706 First Street. \n\nUpon arrival around 0700 hours, Constable FLUFFY and Constable Errick encountered a Darren GORRELL at 706 First Street, who stated he did not know Matthew. Observing the proximity of 704 and 706 First Street as a duplex, they proceeded to 704 First Street, where they met Matthew ACHNEEPINESKUM, who appeared intoxicated. Matthew admitted that the incident was a prank intended for a TikTok video, confessed to fabricating the story, and apologized multiple times. Constable FLUFFY verified Matthew was not injured and did not require medical attention. \n\nThe officers warned Matthew that he could face charges of public mischief for providing false information but used officer discretion in deciding not to press charges. This report is filed for documentation purposes due to the nature of the call as a weapons report. No further action is required at this time. End of Report. 3602 - 2023/08/10 1729.",
